# angularnavigation
How navigation works in angular?
This project demonstrates the implementation of navigation and routing in Angular applications. It focuses on how to move between different components or pages using Angular’s RouterModule, along with setting up routes, router links, and navigation guards. The experiment aims to help understand single-page application (SPA) behavior, where the page does not reload during navigation.

Process:
1.create new project using ng new nav command.
2.create two components home and about using ng g c compname command.
3.Then updates paths in app.route.ts
